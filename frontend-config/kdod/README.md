## KDOD Config Instructions

The KDOD configuration includes additional fields and sections specific to patient registration that may not be relevant to most of our implementors. When generating a release, please ensure that the object with the key `@kenyaemr/esm-patient-registration-app` in the `kenyaemr-config` is replaced with the corresponding object from the KDOD configuration.
